My name is Stefan

I am physicist by training. At university I worked on fluid dynamics, particle simulation, soft condensed matter. 
Later I got employed by a company using laser, sound and L-band radar technology to build remote sensing equipment to 
measure wind speed, temperature and turbulence properties. Currently, life is paid for by the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, a 
partially publicly funded German non-profit organisation where our group works on laser based ranging, lidar remote 
sensing techniques and image processing for railroad infrastructure inspection.

I write software for data acquistion and data evaluation, simulations and user interfaces, mostly in C++ because we move 
lots of bits around and because we need to interface to hardware efficiently.
